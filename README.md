# Pressure Transient Analysis in Oil Gas with Python
I developed a robust program that simulates the Pressure Buildup Test, a critical procedure in reservoir engineering. The program processes well test data from the buildup phase to accurately estimate essential reservoir properties, including permeability and the skin factor. By analyzing pressure variations over time, the program facilitates a detailed assessment of the reservoir's fluid transmissibility and any potential near-wellbore damage or enhancement, as indicated by the skin factor. This comprehensive analysis aids in optimizing well performance and supports the formulation of effective reservoir management and development strategies.
